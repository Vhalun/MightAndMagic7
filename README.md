# MightAndMagic7

I really wanted to listen my favorite adventure music collections, while I'm doing
some dungeon crawling. Sadly I wasn't able to turn of the music, so I just disabled
the music playing thread in the audio.dll. I tried to search for differnt solutions,
but non of them worked for me :(

Installation:
1.) Go to your installation dir. Maybe like this: D:\Programs\GOG Galaxy\Games\Might and Magic 7\
2.) Rename the audio.dll to audio.bak 
3.) Copy the new audio.dll inside the folder
4.) Have fun with the game!
